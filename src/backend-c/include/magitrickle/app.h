/* App layer — port of the group/interface/config-save slice of app.go's
 * App struct (compatibility-contract.md §2). Promotes what main.c
 * (Phase 5) built ad hoc into a reusable module the HTTP handlers
 * (Phase 6) can drive at runtime.
 *
 * Ownership model: mt_app_t does NOT own `cfg` (borrowed from main.c,
 * which loaded it before creating the app and keeps it alive for the
 * daemon's lifetime) but DOES treat cfg->groups as the live, mutable
 * group registry -- unlike Go, where a.userRuleSets (not config.Groups,
 * which doesn't even exist as an AppConfig field) is the runtime source
 * of truth and SaveConfig() reconstructs a fresh []*models.Group from
 * each RuleSet's Model() at save time. Because every mt_ruleset_t here
 * stores a `const mt_group_t *` pointing directly at the pointee inside
 * cfg->groups (an array of pointers, so appending/removing entries
 * reallocates the pointer array but never invalidates the pointees
 * themselves), keeping cfg->groups authoritative means mt_app_save_config
 * can just call the existing mt_config_save_file directly -- no
 * reconstruction step needed, unlike Go.
 *
 * Each mt_ruleset_t here also owns its own dedicated ipt4/ipt6/rtnl
 * *references* (borrowed from the shared deps, per decisions.md D-20).
